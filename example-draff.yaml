# ===========================================================================
# Rewrites
# ===========================================================================
# Rewrites are regular expressions that alter values in particular fields.
# They're applied prior to aggregation,
# so you can use them to deduplicate similar/redundant messages.
rewrites:
    url.path:  # The name of the field to alter.
        # The key is a regular expression of text to match in the specified field;
        # the value is what to replace the matched text with.
        # Example: hide UUIDs.
        '\b[0-9A-F]{8}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{4}-[0-9A-F]{12}\b': '<deduped>'


# ===========================================================================
# Annotations
# ===========================================================================
# Annotations are regular expressions that add links to matched text.
# You can use this to reference issues you've reported but haven't fixed yet,
# as a reminder to refrain from filing duplicate reports.
annotations:
    # The key is a regular expression of text to match in any field;
    # the value is what the matching text should link to.
    # Example: in log messages about 404 errors, add a reminder about the issue I created for adding a favicon.

# ===========================================================================
# Summaries
# ===========================================================================
# Each summary is a section in the output email;
# it matches (selects) certain log messages,
# then formats them into a table (or multiple tables).
# Summaries are processed in the same order that they appear here.
summaries:
    # Example: summarize HTTP 404 errors:
    🕷 HTTP 404 not found:  # This is the display name of this summary block.
        select:
            # `select` is an array of hashes.
            # The outer array is ORred;
            # the inner hash is ANDed.
            # The hash key is the field to filter on;
            # the hash value is a regular expression to apply to the field's value.
            # Example: match log messages that either have Drupal Watchdog Type `page not found`, OR (came from Apache access logs AND have HTTP response code 404).
            - drupal.type: ^page not found$
            - event.dataset: ^apache.access$
              http.response.status_code: ^404$
        charts:
            # `charts` take the log messages selected above
            # and format them into tables.
            # Each chart in a summary operates on the same set of messages,
            # allowing you to aggregate the data in different ways.
            # Example: show which target URLs are returning 404 errors:
            Grouped by target URL:  # This is the display name of this summary block's chart.
                group_by:
                    - server.domain
                    - url.path
                show_fields:
                    - server.domain
                    - url.path
                    - user_agent.name  # This field isn't part of the group_by, so its column is labeled "(poly)" to indicate that each table cell in this column shows just a single representative value, but there may be other values not shown.
            # Example: show which clients are making requests that result in 404 errors:
            Grouped by client IP:
                group_by: client.ip
                show_fields:
                    - client.ip
                    - client.domain
                    - server.domain
                    - url.path
        # Draff automatically converts the `select` query into a link to Kibana Discover.  If the automatically-generated query is inadequate, you can optionally override it:
        kibana_query: 'drupal.type:"page not found" OR (event.dataset:apache.access AND http.response.status_code:404)'

    # Example: summarize IMAP logins:
    📬 IMAP Login:
        select:
            - log.syslog.identifier: ^dovecot$
              process.name: ^imap-login$
              event.action: ^Login$
        charts:
            Grouped by user + IP:
                count: 1000  # By default, draff shows the top 5 groups with the most occurrences.  You can pick a higher number to see more groups.
                group_by:
                    - client.user.name
                    - client.ip
                show_fields:
                    - client.user.name
                    - client.ip
                    - client.domain

    🕷 HTTP 5xx server error:
        concern: true  # This causes the summary block to be highlighted in yellow, indicating that any messages here are potentially concerning.
        select:
            - event.dataset: ^apache.access$
              http.response.status_code: ^5
        charts:
            Grouped by URL + status:
                group_by:
                    - server.domain
                    - url.path
                    - http.response.status_code
                show_fields:
                    - server.domain
                    - url.path
                    - http.response.status_code
                    - client.domain

    # This last summary is a catch-all.
    # It doesn't have a `select`,
    # so it collects all events that weren't already processed by preceding summaries.
